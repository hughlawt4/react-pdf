Difficulties had arisen in their marriage. Elaine erroneously suspected that Kevin was having an extramarital affair. One evening, she questioned Kevin on this suspicion in the garage of their family home. Kevin denied that he was having an affair, and threatened that he would take his own life if his wife did not believe his denial. He then took a shotgun (for which he had a licence) with the intent, he claims, to put it to his own head. He also claims that the gun ‘discharged accidentally’ due to the unexpected movement of Elaine. This resulted in Elaine being fatally shot. Kevin alleges that Elaine lurched towards him (to prevent him from committing suicide), pushing the gun, which resulted in a shot being discharged. Kevin denies that he intended to kill his wife and claims that her death was an accident. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br>\nAdvise Kevin on <strong><u>both</u></strong> of the following:</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br>\n<strong>(a)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With reference to appropriate law, advise Kevin on his possible criminal liability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><u><strong>AND</strong></u></p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;With reference to appropriate law, advise Kevin on the presumption of innocence which exists in Irish law and the obligation for the prosecution to prove the case against him.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Last week, he forcibly entered Emma’s house. Emma was asleep in the living room, and awoke to Adam placing a hand over her mouth and pressing a knife against her neck. When Emma attempted to raise the alarm by screaming, he threatened to kill her. He instructed her to remove her clothing and when she refused, he struck her to the face on a number of occasions. He then proceeded to rape her vaginally while at all times threatening her with a knife. Emma was also subjected by force to oral intercourse. These events occurred over a 4 hour period, during which Emma was confined in the living room. Emma only escaped when Adam fell asleep.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\">With reference to appropriate law, outline and discuss Adam’s potential criminal liability.</p>\n",

Nevertheless, in some limited circumstances the actus reus for a given offence may also comprise an omission. On such occasions the criminal law is concerned with the failure of a person to act.” &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\nL Campbell et al, Criminal Law in<em> Ireland</em> (2010, Clarus Press), p. 81</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\">With reference to appropriate law, critically discuss criminal omissions in the light of this statement.</p>\n",

He decided to put his skills to use by engaging in a scam with customers of the Bank of Munster. He sent the customers deceptive emails claiming to be from the Bank of Munster and requiring them to follow a link embedded in the false email to a website mimicking the banks own e-banking application. Unsuspecting customers entered their e-banking details on the fake web- site. John then used these details to transfer funds from the customers’ bank accounts to so-called ‘mule’ accounts in the same bank. He then extracted the funds from the mule accounts at the bank counter or at ATMs.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Larry, a drug addict, was desperately in need of cash. He approached, Paulo and Maria, an Italian couple who were visiting Dublin for the weekend. &nbsp;He pointed a blood-filled syringe at Maria, and told Paulo that he would stab her unless Paulo handed over his wallet to him. Paulo handed over his wallet to Larry, but he was caught by two members of An Garda Síochána before he could leave the scene.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><strong>(c)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Melissa was very jealous of her cousin, Ann. She was recently invited to a party at Ann’s apartment. Melissa behaved very badly at the party and was rude to all of Ann’s guests. Ann asked Melissa to leave. Melissa was shocked that she was asked to leave by Ann. In protest, she locked herself in the bathroom. She then put a blanket down the toilet and repeatedly flushed it to flood the bathroom. &nbsp;The bathroom flooded quickly, and it also spread to the entrance hall. The flooding damaged Ann’s new wood floors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><strong>(d)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mal and Tom are friends. Mal dislikes his wife, Mary. &nbsp;One evening, whilst in the pub, Mal encouraged Tom to go home to his (Mal’s) house, and have sexual intercourse with Mary, who had gone to bed. Mal suggested disingenuously that if she resisted, this was part of the pretence. Tom was not influenced by Mal’s encouragement and refused to go to Mal’s house.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Liam has had a substance addiction problem for approximately five years. &nbsp; Apart from alcohol, he had been spending €200 a week on cocaine, crystal ecstasy, and cannabis. He has never previously been violent to his father. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\nOne evening, after consuming large quantities of alcohol and cocaine, Liam returned home and met his father. Liam claims that he was internally very perplexed on the evening in question. He was also very intoxicated. He believed as part of a delusion that terrorists were invading his home, and that he was being pursued by them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\nWhen Liam’s father asked him if he was alright, Liam repeatedly stabbed him with a kitchen knife. Mike died as a result of the multiple stab wounds. Liam claimed that he killed him with a knife because he ‘was an imposter and was not his real father’, and that he ‘received a message from the television to do so’. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\">There is some medical evidence to suggest that Liam’s many years of drug misuse has damaged his brain function, and has reduced his control over his actions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\">Advise Liam on his possible criminal liability.</p>\n",

Your client Philip has been arrested and is being held in Tralee Garda station. You visit him there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\nPhilip informs you that he had consumed a large amount of alcohol that evening. He walked to his car, sat in to the driver’s seat, turned on the engine and the lights, and then fell asleep. Garda Flannery knocked on the car window and then opened the car door. He discovered that there was a strong smell of alcohol coming from Philip, and that his eyes were glazed and his speech was slurred. Philip indicated to him that he wished to drive home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\nAt this point, Garda Flannery formed the opinion that Philip was under the influence of an intoxicant to such an extent as to render him incapable of having proper control of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place. He also formed the opinion that Philip was in charge of the car and had ‘intent’ to drive. He told Philip that he was under arrest for being ‘drunk in charge of a motor vehicle with intent to drive it’. Philip claims that Garda Flannery did not inform him of the relevant statutory provision under which he was being arrested.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\nPhilip also tells you that he has three previous convictions for drunk driving, and that he is planning to leave Ireland for the US next week to start a job. He wonders if this will impact on any bail application which he might make, and what, if any bail conditions, might apply. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\nWith reference to appropriate law, advise Philip on <u><strong>both</strong></u> of the following.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\n<strong>(a)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;The requirements for a lawful arrest, particularly the extent to which he should be informed of the factual basis and legal authority for his arrest. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\n<u><strong>AND</strong></u>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\n<strong>(b)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;The factors that will be taken in to account in his bail application, and the types of conditions which can attach if Philip is admitted to bail.</p>\n",

During his trial, he raised the defence of insanity, and stated that at the time of the relevant act, he was suffering from schizophrenia. The jury rejected Larry’s defence of insanity. Larry has commenced his prison sentence. Recently new evidence has come to light, which was not available at trial, which shows that Larry was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time he committed the crime. Larry believes that he is a victim of a miscarriage of justice. He asks you to which court he can appeal, and he also asks you to outline the scope, composition and jurisdiction of this Court.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\nBernie was a member of the IRA, and has a long list of convictions for terrorist related offences. Recently he has been charged with indicatable tax offences under the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The DPP is concerned that the ordinary Courts are inadequate to&nbsp;secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to Bernie’s trial. Bernie asks you to explain to him where the case will be held given the DPP’s concerns, and he also asks you to outline the scope, composition and jurisdiction of this court.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><br />\nAdvise <u><strong>both</strong></u> Larry and Bernie on the scope, composition and jurisdiction of the respective courts where their cases will be heard.</p>\n",

His friend, Tommy, recently called to his house. Tommy took 4 kayaks out of a van, and told Gavin that he had stolen them from a shop in Waterford. He asked Gavin to mind them for a few weeks until he figured out what to do with them. Gavin did as requested, though he was not involved in theft of the kayaks. The Gardaí subsequently discovered the kayaks in Gavin’s shed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><strong>(b)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Denis and Michael run a company selling health products. In order to attract a new investor, Seamus, they altered their financial accounts by misstating 15 transactions. &nbsp;These misstatements purported to show a positive balance in the company’s accounts of €750,000 when in reality it was operating at a loss. Seamus invested €200,000 in the company and soon discovered the fraud.</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><strong>(c)</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Petra is a witness in an action between her and the Bank of Leinster. The proceedings were an application by the bank in respect of a mortgage which it had entered into with Petra. There was an outstanding sum of €40,000 on the mortgage. Petra was very emotional and started to object during the proceedings, claiming that Ms Justice Lex was doing her ‘a grave injustice’. &nbsp;Ms Justice Lex tried to continue with the proceedings, but she was interrupted, repeatedly, by Petra who claimed that the judge was a ‘puppet in the hands of the banks’, and that she ‘had a right to speak in court’. Petra also shouted at the lawyers for the bank and the judge that they ‘had blood on [their] hands’, and she threw leaflets around the court which stated that the justice system ‘only protected big business’. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"text-justify\"><strong>(d)&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;Dan is a farmer living in Co Mayo. He hired Mary, an accountant, to do his accounts. Mary did the work, and charged him an agreed rate which was fair having regard to industry norms. Dan, however, thinks that Mary’s prices were exorbitant and decided to take some revenge. He recently sent her three anonymous letters which contained numerous profanities and insults, suggesting that she was a ‘horrible person’, and a ‘corrupt cow’. Mary was very shocked on receiving these letters and passed them on to the Gardaí. Dan also sent an anonymous letter to Mary’s employer ‘to warn him’ about Mary, stating that she was a ‘corrupt and exploitative bean counter’. Leaflets were also put on the car windscreens of Mary’s neighbours, claiming that she was a ‘corrupt swindler’ and a ‘fraudster’. Dan also sent emails from a hushmail account to Mary and her colleagues in work alleging that she is ‘a fraudster’. Mary is very&nbsp;shocked and frightened by all of these communications. She has never engaged in fraudulent behaviour.&nbsp;</p>\n"
